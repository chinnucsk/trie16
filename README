This is testing Erlang trie implementation. It uses binary key and value can be
any erlang term. Trie tree is branched on byte boundary and should support
substring nodes. For byte lookup will be used two level tree using tuples of
size 16.

Trie will support only set and get operrations but not delete. Delete can be add
in future but not intended now.

Purpose of this module is compare its memory and performance characteristics to
other key-value storage and learn something myself.
